When using, there's a feature called "user data" that I was able to use to automate tasks when setting up a virtual machine in the cloud. It's like a set of instructions or a recipe that I can provide to the virtual machine to follow automatically.

With user data, I can save time and reduce errors because I can write a script with all the necessary steps and configurations, which I have already tested and verified. For example, if I have an application that I want to run on the virtual machine, I can include the instructions in the user data script.

When I launch the virtual machine, it will automatically run the script and start the application for me. And when I stop the virtual machine, I can configure the script to stop the application gracefully, which helps save costs by only running the application when needed.

Sparta Test app is run on nodejs because is efficient, fast, and can handle many users at once. It also has a wide range of ready-made tools and libraries that developers can use to build applications more easily. Additionally, Node.js has a large community of developers who provide support, resources, and solutions to common problems.Node.js makes it easier to create web applications with JavaScript, and its features make it a popular choice for building modern and responsive web apps.
